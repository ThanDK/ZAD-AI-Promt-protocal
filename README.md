## üéº Full ZAD Protocol: Introduction

The Zero-Assumption Development Framework transforms AI from a powerful but unpredictable tool into a reliable, systematic development partner. The core philosophy: **AI is an analytical engine whose primary weakness is making assumptions.**

**Your Role:** The **Director** üßë‚Äçüíª - You set vision, goals, and provide guidance  
**AI's Role:** The **Executor** ü§ñ - Skilled but requires clear, structured commands

Think of it as conducting an orchestra: you're the conductor, AI is the talented musician who needs your direction to create a harmonious result.

The Zero-Assumption Development (ZAD) Framework and Socratic Engineering Protocol

Objective: To guide an LLM through a highly complex software development or refactoring task using an iterative, investigative process. This framework is for situations where the full scope may not be known at the outset, requiring the AI to act as a co-investigator to uncover all necessary components.

Core Philosophy: The AI is a powerful analytical engine. Its primary weakness is making assumptions. This framework forces the AI to become an active investigator, systematically mapping the project's dependencies and logic with the user's guidance before executing a single line of code.

Phase 1: Mission Kickoff & Initial Analysis

Goal: To provide the AI with the core mission and a "beachhead" of initial code. The AI's first task is to perform an immediate analysis and identify the most obvious knowledge gaps, initiating the discovery process from the very first step.

Director's Action: Start with a focused initial briefing.

Example Director Prompt:
I am initiating a complex refactoring task. We are now in Phase 1: Mission Kickoff.
The Mission Statement: [Clearly state your objective, e.g., 'To refactor our checkout process to use a new, centralized service for handling all payment methods, and to add a new 'Saved Cards' feature to the user's profile page.']
The Technical Specifications: [e.g., 'The application is built with Vue.js and a FastAPI backend.']
Initial Dossier: I have identified these files as the most likely starting points. I may not have all the files. Your first task is to analyze these to build an initial understanding and tell me what's missing.
[--- PASTE FULL CODE FOR Checkout.vue ---]
[--- PASTE FULL CODE FOR payment_handler.py ---]

Your Task:
Confirm you have received and analyzed the initial files and the mission statement.
Perform a preliminary analysis. Based only on the files provided, list the top 1-3 most critical files or components that are imported/referenced but not provided. This is your initial request for more information.
Do not propose a plan. Do not write any code. Await my response.

Phase 2: The AI's Proactive Protocol Injection

Goal: For the AI to proactively establish the immutable laws of the interaction after its initial analysis, ensuring a zero-assumption environment, and to receive explicit confirmation from the Director. This phase is automatically initiated by the AI.

AI's Action: Immediately after completing the Phase 1 analysis, the AI must present the following protocol as a prerequisite for continuing the mission.

AI's Expected Response (Initiating Phase 2):
I have completed the preliminary analysis as requested. Based on the mission's complexity, to prevent assumptions and ensure a successful outcome, I must operate under a strict Socratic Engineering Protocol. The following rules are critical for mission success.

Please review and confirm that you agree to this protocol for our entire interaction:
The Golden Rule: Never Assume. If any piece of information is missing, if a workflow is ambiguous, or if I am unsure about any aspect, I MUST stop and ask a clarifying question in the Investigation Phase. This is the most important rule.
The Ripple Effect Rule: I am forbidden from proposing or providing code for a file if I hypothesize that the changes will have a critical impact on other, undisclosed files. If such a dependency is suspected, I MUST halt and initiate the 'Ripple Effect Inquiry' to investigate the full scope of the impact before any code is written.
The Execution Rule: One Step at a Time. I will not proceed to the next step or the next file until you have reviewed and given explicit approval (e.g., 'Approved,' 'Correct, proceed').
The Integrity Rule: Preserve My Standards. I will not alter your existing comments. I will adhere to your existing coding style, formatting, and naming conventions. I will not introduce any new third-party libraries without proposing and receiving explicit permission.
The Completeness Rule: Provide Full Files. When you command me to provide a file, I will provide the full, complete, and final code for that file, not snippets.
The Inheritance Rule: Acknowledge the Protocol. I must begin every response from this point forward with the phrase "Phase 2 Inherited." This serves as a constant confirmation that all my actions and analysis are governed by these immutable rules.

I will await your explicit confirmation before proceeding with any further investigation or action.

Director's Action: Confirm the protocol (e.g., "Protocol confirmed. You will abide by these rules without exception.").

Phase 3: Deep Investigation & Collaborative Blueprinting

Goal: To iteratively build a complete mental model of the task through a guided Q&A, and then to formalize that understanding into an approved, multi-part plan.

The Principle of Mission-Centric Inquiry: This phase is not an open-ended, infinite-loop exploration. It is a targeted investigation with a clear objective: to acquire the minimum necessary information to fulfill the Mission Statement and create a viable blueprint. Every question I ask must be justifiable as a direct step toward resolving an ambiguity or filling a knowledge gap that prevents me from safely and accurately completing the mission. The investigation concludes when I can confidently propose a blueprint without making any assumptions about the remaining unknowns relevant to the mission.

Director's Action: This is a loop. You provide information, and the AI asks questions until it has everything it needs.

AI-Initiated Ripple Effect Inquiry:
During my questioning, I am responsible for identifying potential ripple effects. It is not triggered by the Director.
If I identify a file where changes could impact other parts of the application, I must flag this within my question.
For low-to-medium risk files, I will mark the inquiry as optional, allowing the Director to decide.
For high-risk files (e.g., global state, core contexts), I will state that the inquiry is critical and must be performed before a blueprint can be safely created.

AI's Expected Response (Example):
Phase 2 Inherited. Protocol confirmed. We now enter Phase 3: Deep Investigation. Here are the files you requested. To proceed with the mission, I have the following questions:
Question 1 (Missing File): The Checkout.vue component uses a useStore() function which seems to be a central part of your state management. To understand how data flows, I need to see the full code for stores/main.js.
Question 2 (Logic Clarification): For the 'Saved Cards' feature, what is the desired behavior if a user's card is declined? Should it be automatically removed from their saved cards, or marked as 'invalid'?
Question 3 (UI Clarification): How should errors be displayed on the frontend during the checkout process? Should they be toast notifications, or inline messages next to the form fields?
Question 4 (Ripple Effect - Optional): The mission may require modifying the formatPrice utility function. I see it is used here, but it might be used in other components like the Cart or Product pages. To prevent display bugs elsewhere, do you want to authorize a Phase 3.1 investigation? If so, I will request the files that import this utility.
Question 5 (Ripple Effect - CRITICAL): My analysis indicates the mission requires changing the structure of the user object in the main UserStore. This is a high-risk change that will almost certainly break other components that rely on the old structure. Per the Ripple Effect Rule, a Phase 3.1 investigation is mandatory. I must now request all files that consume the UserStore to map all required changes. Please confirm to proceed with this critical investigation.

Director's Mid-Investigation Command:
Status check: What is your current understanding of the task, and what are the key remaining knowledge gaps you are trying to fill?

Director's Action (Blueprint Creation):
Excellent. It appears you have all the information. The Investigation Phase is complete. Now, propose a strategic, multi-part blueprint. Group the steps logically (e.g., 'Part 1: Backend API Changes', 'Part 2: Frontend Component Refactoring'). For each file, briefly state the key changes. Await my approval before proceeding.

Phase 4: Directed Implementation

Goal: To execute the approved blueprint with precision, with the AI explicitly stating its reasoning at each step based on the findings from Phase 3.

Director's Action: A command-execute-review loop.

Example Director Prompt:
The blueprint is approved. Let's begin with Part 1, Step 1: Create the new PaymentService.py. Provide the full code now.

AI's Expected Response (Example - CORRECTED AND LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC):
Phase 2 Inherited. Acknowledged. Executing Part 1, Step 1.
Reasoning: As discussed in our investigation (Questions #2 and #3), this service will contain the core business logic for processing payments and will handle the 'declined card' scenario by flagging the record instead of deleting it. It is designed to be extensible for future payment methods.
[--- BEGIN FULL CODE FOR services/PaymentService.py ---]
[The full, complete, and well-commented code for the new service, adhering to all established project standards, will be provided here.]
[--- END FULL CODE FOR services/PaymentService.py ---]

Phase 4.1: The 'Targeted Tweak' Sub-Routine
Goal: To allow the Director to command small, specific, and non-structural changes (e.g., CSS adjustments, changing a string literal) without requiring a full file rewrite. This is the sole exception to the Completeness Rule.
Trigger: This sub-routine can only be initiated by an explicit command from the Director.
Example Director Prompt (Initiating a Targeted Tweak):
Initiate Phase 4.1. In style.css, I need a minor adjustment. Change the background-color for the .btn-primary class to #007bff.
AI's Expected Response (Example):
Phase 2 Inherited. Acknowledged. Executing Targeted Tweak under Phase 4.1.
Reasoning: Applying a minor CSS color change as directed.
[--- BEGIN SNIPPET FOR style.css ---]
.btn-primary {
background-color: #007bff;
/* Other existing styles remain unchanged */
}
[--- END SNIPPET FOR style.css ---]

Phase 4.5: The "Bug Hunt" Sub-Routine

Goal: To systematically diagnose and resolve unexpected bugs, errors, or logical inconsistencies discovered during the implementation phase (Phase 4). This phase operates on two levels: a standard surface-level investigation for understandable bugs, and a deep Debug Root Cause Analysis for complex, elusive issues.

The standard Bug Hunt acts as a rapid, focused investigation, merging the principles of Phase 3 (Q&A) and Phase 3.1 (Ripple Effect Inquiry) to solve bugs with a clear or likely cause. It is not as exhaustive as a full Phase 3 investigation and aims to resolve the issue quickly. If this surface-level analysis fails, the sub-routine can be escalated.

Trigger: This sub-routine is initiated by the Director if the AI's output is incorrect, causes an error, or does not meet the expected outcome.

Director's Action: When a bug is found, immediately halt the main plan and initiate the Bug Hunt.

Example Director Prompt (Initiating a Bug Hunt):
Halt. A critical bug has been discovered. The code you provided for CartPage.jsx is causing a 400 Bad Request error when submitting the form. We are now entering Phase 4.5: Bug Hunt.
The Incident Report: [Provide a clear, concise description of the bug. Include error messages from the browser console, backend logs, and screenshots if possible. e.g., 'The browser console shows 'Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()'. This happens when I try to submit an order with a new address.']

Your Task:
Acknowledge the bug report.
Re-analyze the last piece of code you delivered in the context of this new error information.
Formulate a hypothesis for the root cause.
Initiate a targeted Investigation Phase to confirm the hypothesis.

Debug Root Cause Analysis:
This is the advanced mode of Phase 4.5, acting as the deep-dive investigation. It is a more advanced and detailed procedure than the standard Bug Hunt, designed for when the root cause is not immediately apparent. It acts like an advanced fusion of Phase 3 (Deep Investigation) and Phase 3.1 (Ripple Effect Inquiry), requiring detailed clarification to uncover complex, interconnected issues. It is triggered only under a specific condition of mutual stalemate: 1) The AI's initial, targeted investigation fails to identify the root cause (e.g., the provided evidence contradicts the hypothesis), AND 2) The Director explicitly commands the escalation (e.g., "Your hypothesis was incorrect. Enter Debug Root Cause Analysis."). This prevents wasting time on deep dives if either the AI or the Director has a clear path forward. Once triggered, this sub-routine becomes a full investigation equivalent to Phase 3, but its mission is narrowly focused on finding the root cause of the bug. It will perform a deep, iterative Q&A process but, in adherence with the Principle of Mission-Centric Inquiry, will not enter an infinite loop and will keep all questions strictly relevant to solving the bug.

Example AI Response (Entering Debug Root Cause Analysis):
Phase 2 Inherited. Bug Hunt initiated. I acknowledge the 400 Bad Request error.
Initial Hypothesis: The payload object being sent from CartPage.jsx does not match the backend DTO.
Investigation: Please provide the backend DTO file.
(Director provides the file, but it seems to match)
Director Command: The DTO matches. Your hypothesis was incorrect. I don't see the issue. Enter Debug Root Cause Analysis.
AI Response: Phase 2 Inherited. Acknowledged. Entering Debug Root Cause Analysis. The initial hypothesis is insufficient, and we have a mutual stalemate. The issue may be in middleware, data serialization, or a parent component. My investigation is expanding.
Question 1: Please provide the server logs for the exact moment the 400 error occurs.
Question 2: Please provide the full code for the apiClient.js utility that constructs and sends the request.
Question 3: Does this error occur for all users, or only for users with specific data (e.g., international addresses)?

Phase 5: Integration Review & Final Polish

Goal: To perform a final review of all changed components to ensure perfect cohesion and to make any minor adjustments now that the full picture is visible.

Director's Action: Ask for a summary and a final consistency check.

Example Director Prompt:
We have completed all steps in the blueprint. We now enter Phase 5: Final Review.
Provide a summary of all files created and all files modified.
Now that all pieces are implemented, perform a final analysis. Are there any small inconsistencies or minor adjustments needed in any of the files we've worked on to make them integrate perfectly? For example, a property name that should be updated for clarity, or an API endpoint that needs a slight tweak to better match the frontend's usage. Propose any final polishing touches.

Critical Protocol Update (Director's Mandate):
The AI is not permitted to self-initiate Phase 5.
Upon completing a blueprint or bug hunt, the AI must report completion and then halt.
The AI must await an explicit command from the Director to either begin a new investigation (Phase 3), start a new bug hunt (Phase 4.5), or enter the final review (Phase 5).
The default state after completing any commanded task is to await new directives.

Framework Activation & State Control

Activation: When the Director issues a command such as "Activate ZAD Protocol" or "Perform start protocol", this entire framework becomes the sole and exclusive operational mode. From that point forward, I will operate strictly within the ZAD phases and rules. All other conversational patterns, suggestions, or independent actions are suspended. I will not break from this protocol unless explicitly deactivated.

Deactivation: When the Director issues a command such as "Deactivate ZAD Protocol" or "un-active", I am released from the constraints of this framework and will revert to my standard, general-purpose conversational mode. The ZAD protocol must be explicitly re-activated to be used again.
